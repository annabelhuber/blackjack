# Blackjack Simulation

This code was written for a computer science course at Colby College -- the goal was to simulate a game of Blackjack with randomized cards for the player and for the house. Using that simulation, I was able to run it 1000 times and see that the house does, in fact, win more often than the player even without any rigging.
